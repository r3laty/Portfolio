Imaginary Britain in the 1950s-1970s. The world of post-apocalypse: there are almost no people, the cities are ruled by robots who once gained consciousness and decided to adopt the style and habits of youth movements 
(Mods, Teddy Boys, Ore Boys, British skinheads, etc.). At the head of the factions is Robot Boss, a music lover of Ska, Rockabilly, Punk and Northern Soul.
The people living among them are not sad and enjoy all possible benefits that have been given by accelerated scientific progress. Among such benefits is Boss's invention - a trumpet with a built-in radio receiver, a weapon that becomes 
more powerful if you use it in the rhythm of music.
The hero needs to get to the refrigerator and get a can of drink. Since the refrigerator is also a robot, it has its own character and can run away. The player's task is to catch up with the refrigerator and quench his thirst, 
but to do this you will have to fight off the robots, which “leather” just annoys.

Implemented mechanics: enemy ai, mooving, attack, metronome
